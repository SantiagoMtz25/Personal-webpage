                <p class="c-txt">I have always exercised in my life. I started playing tenis, 
                    then I switched to football for a couple of years, 
                    until I discoverd swimming which I fell in love with I went on and swam for more than 8 years.
                    I used to compete and even though, I was not the best at it, it helped me to develop
                    a responsability towards exercise and correct nutrition for myself. During Highshcool I 
                    neglected for certain periods exercising, from now and then I would start exercising but 
                    soon after I would abandoned it. After Highshcool I spent a year trying to figure out my life in 
                    which I did not exercised. It was not until my second semester of university when I strongly commited
                    to the gym, the previous year had been the most complicated one in my life, and I was at my worst
                    physical form, and I hit rock bottom. I decide to turn that situation around, so I established 
                    a nutrition and training plan for me. And I stuck with it for a year. I went from weighing 62kg 
                    to 79kg at my max weight. Today, I am weighing aroung 75kg, and I could not feel better or happier 
                    with my own body.
