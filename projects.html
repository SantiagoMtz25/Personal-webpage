                        In this project I created a project using a proximity sensor connected to cloud,
                        the sensor connected to the cloud using a firebase, sensor could be
                        activated and deactivated from distance through a webpage and assistant
                        Alexa. Information related to sensor's activity was stored in a SQL
                        database. Circuit was constructed and programmed with NodeMCU and Arduino.
                        <br>
                        <br>It represented a big challenge sinca I had never worked before with IoT project
                        but I was able to understand how many things can be done when combining programming
                        with hardware.

                        Helped building an interactive web page for my university's student annual survey 
                        seeking to increase student participation. I used PHP to create and destroy user 
                        sessions when an account was logged in and logged out, to check the credentials and validate the
                        type of users, the PHP code executed a query in a MySQL Database and searched the data of email
                        and password given by the user to see if it exists. 
                        <br>
                        When granting access to an user depending on the type of their account they would be logged to a specific
                        page. Besides, the PHP code, the pages were built using pure HTML and CSS.

                        Since I started learning JavaScript I decided to try a JavaScript Framework, I chose React which
                        is a very popular one. With this project I created JSX components and use them multiple times to build
                        the webpage, it is completely responsive so all components adapt, to any screen size even if its a mobile
                        phone. 
                        <br>
                        With this project I realized that building responsive webpages is very difficult, even though CSS might 
                        look simple, there are many creative and difficult things that can be done. I am planning on learning Tailwind or
                        another CSS framework become better at building webpages.

                        Something about programming that I love is that you can solve your own problems, 
                        I was getting overwhelmed by how many passwords I had to memorize, so I came up with 
                        the idea to create a small program to save my passwords and I could access them by a keyword
                        to remeber what the password I am looking for is about. 
                        <br>
                        Python is a very fun programming language becaues there are thousands of libraries that allow you 
                        to do whatever you have in mind. What I will do next is readjust some issues of the code, and encrypt 
                        the passwords in the text file.
